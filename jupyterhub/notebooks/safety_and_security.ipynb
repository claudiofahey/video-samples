    "\n",
    "![overview](safety_and_security_overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- Live video feeds from 9 cameras are continuously ingested into Streaming Data Platform (Pravega).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pravega asynchronously writes all data to Long Term Storage (ECS, Isilon, or HDFS) for long-term retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Historical and live video can be played back using a simple example application (Jupyter Notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of using Pravega vs. a NAS-only solution\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Pravega writes data *asynchronously* to Long Term Storage (ECS, Isilon, or HDFS) in large blocks, \n",
    "   which means that cost-effective magnetic media can be used.\n",
    "   Without Pravega, all writes must go to Long Term Storage immediately, requiring either expensive low-latency hardware\n",
    "   or reducing durability guarantees.\n",
    "   \n",
    "-  Video frames are written to Pravega atomically. Pravega guarantees that the stream will not be corrupted with partial frames.\n",
    "   Without Pravega, writes to SMB and NFS are generally not atomic.\n",
    "   \n",
    "-  Pravega does not make a video frame is available to readers until the entire video frame has been durably persisted.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Pravega provides low end-to-end latency (15-20 milliseconds) between a camera writing a frame and a video player displaying it.\n",
    "   This is less than 1 frame at 60 frames per second.\n",
    "   **This low latency is impossible to achieve with file-only workflows due to limitations of locking, polling, NFS, and SMB.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "-  Older frames of video streams can be automatically truncated based on time or size limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  The same API can be used to read live video or historical data from years ago, regardless of Long Term Storage technology.\n",
    "   Pravega will serve data cached in memory if available or it will read from Long Term Storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the video feeds\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid the need for a set of live cameras for this demo, we play back video from a set of JPEG files on disk\n",
    "and write each video frame to Pravega.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these videos are from the [VIRAT Video Dataset](https://viratdata.org/)\n",
    "and the [MEVA Video Dataset](http://mevadata.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- We simulate 9 simultaneous ground and aerial cameras.\n",
    "- Maximum video frame size is 1365 x 720 pixels, 140 KB, RGB color, JPEG format.\n",
    "- Each camera records at 10 frames per second.\n",
    "- The total ingest rate is 10 MB/sec.\n",
