    "- Live video feeds from 4 cameras are continuously ingested into Streaming Data Platform (Pravega).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pravega asynchronously writes all data to Long Term Storage (ECS, Isilon, or HDFS) for long-term retention.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "-  Pravega writes data *asynchronously* to Long Term Storage (ECS, Isilon, or HDFS) in large blocks, \n",
    "   which means that cost-effective magnetic media can be used.\n",
    "   Without Pravega, all writes must go to Long Term Storage immediately, requiring either expensive low-latency hardware\n",
    "   or reducing durability guarantees.\n",
    "   \n",
    "-  Video frames are written to Pravega atomically. Pravega guarantees that the stream will not be corrupted with partial frames.\n",
    "   Without Pravega, writes to SMB and NFS are generally not atomic.\n",
    "   \n",
    "-  Pravega does not make a video frame is available to readers until the entire video frame has been durably persisted.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Pravega provides low end-to-end latency (15-20 milliseconds) between a camera writing a frame and a video player displaying it.\n",
    "   This is less than 1 frame at 60 frames per second.\n",
    "   **This low latency is impossible to achieve with file-only workflows due to limitations of locking, polling, NFS, and SMB.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "-  Older frames of video streams can be automatically truncated based on time or size limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  The same API can be used to read live video or historical data from years ago, regardless of Long Term Storage technology.\n",
    "   Pravega will serve data cached in memory if available or it will read from Long Term Storage."
